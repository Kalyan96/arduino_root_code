This code demonstrates my ability to design, develop, and optimize embedded systems and hardware-interfacing programs. Using the Arduino IDE and platform, I have implemented a simple yet efficient control logic for managing outputs across digital pins in a synchronized manner, effectively creating a sequence of actions that can be utilized in various applications, such as LED pattern control, relay triggering, or motor actuation.

Technical Description
Setup Phase:

Configured three digital pins (9, 10, and 11) as output pins using the pinMode() function in the setup() function, ensuring the program initializes hardware resources correctly.
Demonstrated best practices in pin configuration and ensured modularity for further scalability.
Loop Phase:

The loop() function contains a cyclic sequence for toggling the states of the three digital outputs. This is achieved using the digitalWrite() function to set pins to HIGH or LOW, effectively controlling their electrical output.
Implemented a delay() function to introduce time intervals (500 milliseconds) between state transitions, creating a visually appealing or mechanically functional pattern.
The sequence cycles through the following states:
Pin 9 HIGH, 10 and 11 LOW
Pin 10 HIGH, 9 and 11 LOW
Pin 11 HIGH, 9 and 10 LOW
This cycle ensures that the outputs are non-overlapping and precise, demonstrating attention to timing and synchronization in embedded programming.
Robustness and Reusability:

The code is structured for simplicity and clarity, which makes it easy to extend for more complex use cases such as IoT device control, signal modulation, or sequential process automation.
